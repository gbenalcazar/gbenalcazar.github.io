I am an Assistant Professor in the Division of Energy Economics at the [Mineral and Energy Economy Research Institute of the Polish Academy of Sciences](https://min-pan.krakow.pl/en/). I received my Ph.D. in the discipline of Environmental Engineering, Mining and Energy from [AGH University of Science and Technology](https://www.agh.edu.pl/en/university/).

My current work focuses on the design, operation and modeling of combined heat and power systems integrated with energy storage technologies. I'm also interested in mathematical modeling and forecasting in the field of Energy Economics.

If you have any questions or would like to work together, feel free to contact me via [email](mailto:benalcazar@min-pan.krakow.pl).
